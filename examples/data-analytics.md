Data analytics distinguishes itself from data analysis because it tells you what to do and what the result will be. Where data analysis gives you information about the current situation, data analytics makes predictions and tells you what the result would be by taking a certain action. In other words: data analysis focuses on the past and current situation, data analytics focuses on the future.

The case below is an example how to predict churn for recurring customers within an electricity company.

How can we identify objects based on specific characteristics? All these kind of questions can be answered by using data analytics techniques. <br>
<u><u> <b> Result:</b> </u> By using statistics, programming and machine learning techniques, I can find patterns hidden in the data. With this information I can make an algorithm, probability estimation or statistical model which you can use to make the right decisions. <br>
<u> **Duration:** </u>   Project duration varies between 3 weeks â€“ 2 months. The project starts by getting an understanding of the situation and gathering the right data. After collecting the right data, I start analyzing the data and share the results. Finally, I will make the algorithm or model which you can implement in your business.
