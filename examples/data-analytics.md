Data analytics distinguishes itself from data analysis because it tells you what to do and what the result will be. Where data analysis gives you information about the current situation, data analytics makes predictions and tells you what the result would be by taking a certain action. In other words: data analysis focuses on the past and current situation, data analytics focuses on the future.

The case below is an example how to predict churn for recurring customers within an electricity company.

How can we make a recommendation system? How can we categorize our customers? How can we identify objects based on specific characteristics? These types of questions (and many more) can be answered by using data analytics techniques.

With this information I can build an algorithm, statistical model or data application which you can exploit to make the right decisions.

The project starts by gaining an understanding  of the business and data requirements. After collecting the right data, I start analysis and share the results  before delivering a fully documented solution (typically consisting of an algoritm or model).

## Case - Why was company X not getting good candidates?
The ability for a business to understand and forecast the job market is vital in being able to write good job postings which entice apropriately qualified candidates. A start-up company was putting together a new data team and had difficulty in attracting applicants for their senior level positions, despite being successful in recruiting junior staff.

To address this problem, a dataset of the company's job postings as well as similar job postings from LinkedIn and Indeed was put together, combining job titles, job descriptions, techonologies, and salaries. In order to decide on the appropriate modelling technique, we need to understand how company X's postings compare to similar job postings.

## Salary Comparison
For the initial exploratory analysis I used _natural language processing_ to perform key-word analysis on the job titles and descriptions but found no distinguishable difference for the posts by Company X. Next, I built a regression machine learning model to estimate the salary as a function of number of years of experience and at first glance this also looked in order. Drilling down into the data, it became clear that there was a geographical bias in the data which required further salary data be collected.

Now, the is a clear distinction between job salaries in the city that Company X is located vs. the average. Accounting for this difference gave actionable insights which were visualised and communicated back to company X.

## Evaluating success
The machine learning (regression) model was packaged up as a code repository and delivered to Company X along with a set of documentation outlining how to use and maintain the code. The monitoring module allowed Company X to observe an increase in applicants for their senior positions from 1 applicant a week to 6. Furthermore, the company have successfully used this model to calculate the starting salary for more recent job vacancies.
