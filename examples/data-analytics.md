Data analytics distinguishes itself from data analysis because it tells you what to do and what the result will be. Where data analysis gives you information about the current situation, data analytics makes predictions and tells you what the result would be by taking a certain action. In other words: data analysis focuses on the past and current situation, data analytics focuses on the future.

The case below is an example how to predict churn for recurring customers within an electricity company.

&nbsp; How can we make a recommendation system? How can we categorize our customers? How can <br> &nbsp; we identify objects based on specific characteristics? These types of questions (and many more)<br> &nbsp; can be answered by using data analytics techniques.

<img src="/images/example-result.png" align="left" width="80px"/> &nbsp; By combining statistics, machine learning techniques and programming, I can find patterns <br> &nbsp; hidden in data. With this information I can build an algorithm, statistical model or data application which <br> &nbsp; you can exploit to make the right decisions.

<img src="/images/example-duration.png" align="left" width="80px"/> &nbsp; Project duration varies between 2 weeks â€“ 2 months. The project starts by gaining an <br> &nbsp; understanding of the business and data requirements. After collecting the right data, I start <br> &nbsp; analysis and share the results before delivering a fully documented solution (typically consisting of <br> &nbsp; an algoritm or model).
