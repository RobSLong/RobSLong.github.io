About me!
Hi, I'm Rob (also known as @RobDoesData) and this is my first blog post! I am currently working in the UK defence sector in the fuzzy overlapping zone of data engineering and data analytics. I specialise in developing proof-of-concept demonstrations covering all aspects of data and AI by using a combination of Python, PowerBI and most recently, Microsoft Azure. Before this I worked in academia where my research focused on geophysical and astrophysical fluid dynamics, more specifically developing simulations of Earth's core.

**Where did it all begin?** Back in my school days, I was just never really that into it and actually left school when I was a teenager with no qualifications. When I was around 16 I decided to go back into educationt to obtain my GCSEs at the local college and this is where I found my passion for maths and problem solving. Fast forward 6 years and I had completed my GCSEs, my A-levels, a Bachelors degree in Applied Maths and Theoretical Physics and was just starting an integrated Masters and PhD in Fluid Dynamics. For my masters project I investigated flood management by combining a tabletop demonstration model with a numerical algorithm I had developed to describe river flow. I used the demonstration at various public outreach events to engage and educate the general public on the science of extreme weather events and flooding. During my PhD work I got to run supercomputer simulations solving the equations describing fluid flow and publish my work in leading academic journals. As an added bonus, I got to travel all over the world presenting my work at conferences, spent a summer as a visiting researcher at UCLA and won a prestigious presentation award in San Francisco.

**So how did I get in to data?**
Post covid, I really didn't know what I was going to do for work but knew that it was time to go into industry. While I hadn't had any formal education in computer science, I had been responsible for managing my own data during my academic research (at the time I didn't know what ETL was but I had been doing it) and built my own machine learning and data visualisation tools in Python. Data science and data engineering seemed liked  alogical fit so I took the plunge and just a year later I am leading small teams of data analysts. I have had a blast over the last year, rapidly developing my knowledge of databases, AI and cloud/platform engineering.
