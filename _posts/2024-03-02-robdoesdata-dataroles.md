## Summary
Business leaders all too often want to dive straight into the latest and greatest AI, but it is our responsibility as data professionals to communicate that this is a formula for failure. Data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are all reliant on having timely, accurate, high-quality data to drive meaningful impact. Similarly, to ensure that there is consistently good quality data, there must be high-level data management protocols and standards established within the organisation. 

This brings us to the ultimate superhero team-up of <i> <b> The Key Three </b> </i>  who implement governance and management with the analytics and engineering team known as <i> <b> The Core Four</b>. </i>

Let's dive into what makes up the core roles of a data team and see which didn't make the cut!

## The Key Three - governance and management
Data management and governance strategy are vital components of the modern data team. At a high level 

The data owner is typically a senior business leader responsible for specific data domains within the organisation. The data owner has the decision-making authority over respective datasets and must ensure data quality requirements and standards are defined and that privacy and security policies are followed. 

The data steward works closely with the data owner and is more involved with monitoring data quality and compliance with policy. The data steward is often the "go-to" person for data-related questions within a specific data domain.

The final member of the Key Three is the data architect. The architect is the most technical of the three and is responsible for designing and maintaining the data infrastructure in line with the policies and standards outlined above. In addition to the infrastructure, the architect creates high-level designs for data flows, schema, and storage in alignment with the data governance strategy.

## The Core Four - engineering and analytics
The technical team consists of four roles covering the end-to-end engineering and analytical workload cycle. These roles are the data engineer, data analytics engineer, data analyst, and machine learning engineer.

Data engineers are a lynchpin of the modern data team with strong technical ability across both data and software engineering. The data engineer is ultimately responsible for bringing external data into your ecosystem and managing the data infrastructure. The data engineer

The analytics engineer mostly works within the central hub where they ensure clean, transformed datasets are ready for consumption by data analysts and machine learning engineers. They have a good understanding of software engineering practices including version control, unit tests, and CI/CD. A key deliverable of the analytics engineer is up-to-date documentation combining data dictionaries with applied business logic.

The data analyst consumes the datasets prepared by the analytics engineer and carries out deep insight work and forecasting. They are responsible for delivering critical dashboards and working closely with business users to understand changing data requirements.

The technical team is rounded out by the machine learning engineer. The MLE is responsible for all things machine learning, including building ML models and deploying them to production. The MLE is similarly technical to the data engineer but is much more specialised in machine learning. They understand how to properly train, advance, and serve models ensuring scalability and proper monitoring.

## What roles weren't included?
I am sure some people will question, what about the data scientist's role? I have held the title of data scientist myself but in my view, this has always been a rather confusing title. When comparing a "data scientist" with traditional scientists, you see that the amount of experimentation they do makes up such a small amount of the things they actually do. Data scientist is a non-specific job title that in most instances acts as a halfway house between the data analyst and machine learning engineer roles. In the modern data team, this seems redundant. For more discussion on the topic I highly recommend checking out the following podcast.

What about BI (business intelligence) roles? The first issue is that there is some confusion over the title, is there sufficient breadth to have so many different titles; BI developer, BI engineer, and BI analyst? The majority of responsibilities that fall under the various BI roles are shared with the data analyst role. So by not including these, it helps to have a more consistent and transparent distribution of responsibilities by role but also to add value back to the analyst role, which has been lacking.

## Closing thoughts

The current data landscape is thriving with engineering and analytic workloads being matured to the point that we can discuss the pros and cons of data team makeup and structure. Well-defined roles and responsibilities allow teams to efficiently recruit new staff and for teams to quickly identify specialists within their organisation. 

I believe the combination of the core four roles for the technical component and the key three of the management component provides a useful outline for data strategists to use when planning their data teams.
