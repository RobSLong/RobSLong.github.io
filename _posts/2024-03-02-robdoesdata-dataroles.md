# Data Teams - the Core Four and the Key Three


## Summary
This will likely ruffle some feathers

The modern data team consists of two parts; governance and management, and the technical engineering and analytics. 

Business leaders all too often want to dive straight in to the latest and greatest AI - it is our responsibility as data professionals to communicate that this is a formula for failure. Data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence are all reliant on accurate, high quality data to really be useful and drive meaningful impact. Similarly, to ensure that you have good quality data, there must be high level data management protocols and standards established. This brings us on to the ultimate superhero team-up of <i> The Key Three </I> and <i> The Core Four </i>.

## The Key Three - governance and management
Data management and governance strategy is a vital component in the modern data team. At a high level 

The data owner is typically a senior business leader responsible for specific data domains within the organisation. The data owner has the decision making aurhtoriry over respective datasets and must ensure data quality requirements and standards are defined and that privacy and security policies are followed. 

The data steward works closely with the data owner and is more involved with monitoring data quality and compliance with policy. The data steward is often the "go-to" person for data-realted quaestions within a specific data domain.

The finaly member of the Key Three is the data architect. The archtect is the most technical of the three and is responsible for desigining and maintaining the data infrasrtucture inline with the policies and standards outlined above. In addition to the infrastrucutre, the architect designs gives a higih level design of the data flows, schema and storage in alignment with the data governance strategy.

## The Core Four - engineering and analytics
The technical team consists of four roles covering the end-to-end engineering and analytical workload cycle. These roles are the data engineer, data analytics engineer, data analyst and machine learning engineer.

Data engineers are a lynchpin of the modern data team with strong technical ability across both data and software engineering. The data engineer is ultimately responsible for bringing external data into your ecosystem and managing the data infratructure. The data engineer

The analytics engineer mostly works within the central hub where they ensure clean, transofrmed datasets are ready for consumption by data analysts and machine learning engineers. The have a good understanding of software engineering practices inlduing version control, unit tests and CI/CD. A key deliverable of the analytics engineer is up-to-date documentation combining data dictionary with applied business logic.

The data analyst consumes the datasets prepared by the analytics engineer and carries out deep insight work and forecasting. They are responsible for delivery critical dashboards and work closely with business users to understand changing data requirements.

The technical team is rounded out with the machine learning engineer. The MLE is responsible for all things mcahine learning, including building ML models and deploying them to production. The MLE is similarly technical to the data engineer but is much more specialised in machine learning. They understand how to properly train, advance and serve models ensuring scalability and proper monitoring.

# Closing thoughts
I am sure some people will question, what about the data scientist role? In my view data scientist has always been a rather confusing role, those with the title did l,ittle to no experimentation and ultimately the data scientist is a non-specific job title which acts as a halfway house between the data analyst and machine learning engineer roles.

The current data landscape is thriving with engineering and analytic workloads being matured to the point that we can discuss the pros and cons of data team makeup and structure. Well defined roles and responsibilities allows teams to efficiently recruit new staff and for teams to quickly identify specialists within their organisation. 

I believe the combination of the core four roles for the technical component and the key three of the management component provides a useful outline for data strategists to use when planning their data teams.
