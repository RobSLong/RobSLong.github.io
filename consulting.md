As a data engineering and data consultant, I can help you translate data into valuable and comprehensible insights. My goal is to help you identify actionable insights, make the right decisions and save costs.

I am experienced in machine learning, managing the data lifecycle, developing proof of concepts in Microsoft Azure and using data visualization techniques to present the results.
