align="left" works fine. To break the alignment again, use a <br clear="left"/> (or <br clear="right"/>) tag:

<img src="./images/RL-photo.png" align="left" width="200px"/>
some text floating around the image

<br clear="left"/>

A "newline". This text doesn't float anymore, is left-aligned.


# This is a heading
  
This is a paragraph.
